Requirement gathering:
    To create an architecture, the process typically involves three phases: defining the problem, developing user stories, 
    and defining the structure. First, the problem statement outlines the user’s issue and potential solution, focusing on the end-user's needs. 
    For example, the goal might not be to write a blog, but to become influential through writing.

    Next, user stories are created, which describe real users achieving valuable outcomes, not program features. 
    The stories should be concise and small enough to fit on a sticky note. Refining these stories is part of an incremental, 
    agile process, and there’s no need for an exhaustive set of stories before starting development.

Two necessary steps after creating user stories: (Narrowing: Vertical vs Horizontal splitting)
    it's called workflow narrowation
    After creating user stories, they often need refining because they tend to be too large for quick implementation. 
    In agile development, stories should be small enough to fully implement and deploy within a few days. 
    The process of breaking them down is called slicing. Instead of horizontal slicing (UI, business logic, data persistence), 
    which doesn't deliver useful results, vertical slicing (narrowing) is preferred. This involves breaking the story into smaller, 
    complete paths, where each path achieves a valuable outcome for the user. This method, called workflow isolation, 
    simplifies the story by removing alternative workflows. Once stories are refined, the next step is designing the architecture.
