Conway's law: Architecture and organizational strucrure
    Conway's Law suggests that software architecture mirrors the communication structure of an organization. 
    Traditionally, companies have siloed teams (e.g., database, UI, business logic), leading to inefficient communication and slow software development, 
    resulting in layered architectures like N-Tier systems. Agile methodologies, on the other hand, prioritize cross-functional teams that work on 
    vertical slices of the entire system. This approach requires a shift from siloed architectures to more flexible, modern architectures like microservices, 
    which align better with agile practices. The key takeaway is that the software architecture should adapt to reflect the new organizational structure and workflow, enabling faster and more efficient development. 
    Failure to change the architecture when adopting agile can lead to inefficiencies and hinder the benefits of the agile approach.
